# test-template
This Kotlin test template is used to automate Selenium tests in runtime using CSS Selectors. 


How To Use? 

- Using the POM (Page object model) create page objects of your web application within a pages or page objects package. Each page youâ€™re testing should have its own page object.

- On the BasePage, make sure to replace the URL with the URL of the website you will be testing. 

- Setup the driver and the pages.

- Setup the CSS Selectors you'll be testing on each page.

- Create your test functions to run your tests.
